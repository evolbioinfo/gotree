# Gotree: toolkit and api for phylogenetic tree manipulation
## Github repository
[Gotree github repository](https://github.com/evolbioinfo/gotree).
## Introduction
GoTree is a set of command line tools to manipulate phylogenetic trees. It is implemented in [Go](https://golang.org/) language.

The goal is to handle phylogenetic trees in [Newick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format) format, through several basic commands. Each command may print result (a tree for example) in the standard output, and thus can be piped to the standard input of the next gotree command.

## Installation
### Binaries
You can download already compiled binaries for the latest release in the [release](https://github.com/evolbioinfo/gotree/releases) section.
Binaries are available for MacOS, Linux, and Windows (32 and 64 bits).

Once downloaded, you can just run the executable without any other downloads.

### From sources
In order to compile gotree, you must first [download](https://golang.org/dl/) and [install](https://golang.org/doc/install) Go on your system.

Then you just have to type :
```bash
go get github.com/evolbioinfo/gotree/
```
This will download GoTree sources from github, and all its dependencies.

You can then build it with:
```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/evolbioinfo/gotree/
make
```
The `gotree` executable should be located in the `$GOPATH/bin` folder.

## Commands

Here is the list of all commands, with the link to the full description, and a link to a snippet that does it in GO.
